The design choices i made were mainly centered around the fact that the customer base will be in the older ranges and not younger people so i changed the design from grid view to list view. I Also made sure to make the components larger for easy viewing and fully mobile compatible. The design maintains all features and also each card has a dropdown that includes all the details about each skip because people like details about their purchases and giving them more information before a purchase builds stronger customer relations and make purchases more likely. in essence the design prioritizes some modern aspects to appeal to older generations but also remains simple and clear without too much optimization which fits the customer base for this type of product
